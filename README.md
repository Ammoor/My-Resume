This repo contains my resume's latest version and shows all its previous versions.

I used [FlowCV](https://app.flowcv.com/dashboard) to make the resume because it has many advantages **:**
 - Easy to use and understand
 - Easy to customize your resume and modify it
 - Has many features and options
 - Has many resume templates that follow the ATS rules
 - All the needed functions are totally free and some extra utilities are paid

The current resume **ATS** score in [Resume Worder](https://resumeworded.com/) is **72/100**.

If you like the resume template, you can find similar ones in the **classic templates section**.

If you have any feedback on the resume, please let me know.
